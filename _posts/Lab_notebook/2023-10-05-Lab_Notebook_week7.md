> ### Variables and Assigments
> > #### Variable: an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value
    - can't use spaces in a variable
    - Integer: number; usually for math
    - String: text
    - Boolean; true or false
    - Storing variable:  Score ← 10

> ### Data Abstraction

> > #### Strings
    - An ordered sequence of character
    - May contain letters, numbers and all other special characters
    - Wors, phrases, sentences, ID numbers

> > #### Lists
    - An ordered sequence of elements
    - Each element is a variable

> > #### List index
    - Each element of a string is referenced by an index
    - Index start at 1 for AP exam
        - eg.animals: [“zebra”(1),”elephant”(2),...]

> ### Data Abstraction -Lists

- Lists allow for data abstraction
    - Bundle variables together
    - Strings, numbers, characters 
        - Eg: colors ← [“red”,”blue”,”green”]

> ### How lists manage complexity of a program

- May no need as many variables
    - Variable for each students vs 1 variable
    = No need to add/delete entire variable
    - Consistent computations
