## SASS:

 - CSS changes the style of your webpage
 - SCSS better for complex styling and working in projects with multiple pages with lots of customization
 - ### Modular SCSS:
   - Each piece (module) focuses on a specific part
   - separate folders for different types of styles, so your code is more organized and manageable.
 - ### Operators:
   - (+,-,*,/) use use to dynamically adjust sizes, position, or other sytle properties based on certain conditions or user interactions.
 - ### Conditional Statements:
   - @if, @else, and @else if allow developers to apply different styles based on conditions.
 - ### Loops: 
   - @for and @each, enable developers to iterate through lists of values or apply styles multiple times. 
 - ### Functions:
   - Functions in SASS enable developers to encapsulate complex logic and calculations. This is valuable for creating dynamic styles that respond to various inputs or conditions


## Python/Flask
 - SQLAlchemy: Python tool for interacting with SQL database
 - structure for database table in models
 - uses ./migrate.sh to initilize changes to your databse
 - Flask app object: The Flask app object represents the core of a Flask web application. It is created using the Flask() constructor and serves as the central point for configuring the application, defining routes, and managing various components.
 - SQLAlchemy (SQLA) db object: The SQLAlchemy db object is an instance of the SQLAlchemy class, acting as a bridge between a Flask application and the database. It simplifies database interactions by allowing developers to work with Python objects as if they were database entities, providing a high-level interface for tasks like defining models and performing queries.
 - Use db.create_all() for table initialization. Comment on the process.
 - ### Intergrating Flask with SQL:
        from flask import Flask
        from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

        app = Flask(name)
        app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///site.db'
        db = SQLAlchemy(app)
 - ### Create(Inserting Data):
        @app.route('/add_user', methods=['POST'])
        def add_user():
            username = request.form['username']
            password = request.form['password']
            new_user = User(username=username, password=password)
            db.session.add(new_user)
            db.session.commit()
            return 'User added'
 - ### Read data:
        @app.route('/users')
        def users():
            users = User.query.all()
            return render_template('users.html', users=users)
        Update and Delete: Similar structure to Create and Read, with appropriate SQL commands.
        Building a User Registration Form
        HTML Form:
        html
        Copy code
        <form action="/add_user" method="post">
            <input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username">
            <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password">
            <input type="submit" value="Register">
        </form>

## JWT implementation
 - JWT: json web token;  Compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties - Commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web development
 -  Compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties - Commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web development
 - HTTP Cookies: pieces of information/data that a web server sends to a user’s browser and are stored on a user’s device
 - Relation to Cookies → session Token is sent with each subsequent request from client to server, typically in the form of an HTTP Cookie
 - Authentication → with JWT, the server verifies a signature given to the JWT to ensure authenticity and bases the user’s authenticity based on whether or not the signature is valid therefore trusted
