## What I learned this week

> ### Algorithms -3.3 & 3.4

- It is a step by step procedures or set of rules used to solve problems or perform tasks (aka, sequencing)
- Iteration: Repetition;loop
- Fibonacci: A fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It commonly starts with 0 and 1, and the sequence continues infinitely. the first few numbers in the finacci sequence are : 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34
- Factorial: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120
len(str) countes the number of characters in a string; also works for lists
- Substring example
    string = "Hello, world!"
    Substring - string[2:10]
    print(substring)
result: llo, wor

> ### Booleans If

- True or False
- NOT condition: flips what is currently stored in the variable without impacting the variable/condition itself
    -eg. 
    ```
    israining --> true
    x --> not israining
    x --> false
    ```

- AND condition: checks both conditions to produce one single Boolean true or false
- OR condition: checks whether or not one of the conditions is true or false
