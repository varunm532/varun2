***

> -  <font color="567DDA">8/20/23: I fixed the code by typing a *#* on line 7 on Makefile so I can run *make* to run my local server. <font>
> -  <font color="567DDA">*Make* didn't work because I accdently cloned the teacher repo to my student directory. To fix this: *ls teacher/* then *rm -rf teacher*. This removed the teacher repository <font>
> -  <font color="567DDA">8/23/23: When *run all* in linux_shell.ipnb fail due to gem *mdless not found* typing in the vs terminal * gem install mdless * fixed the issue <font>
