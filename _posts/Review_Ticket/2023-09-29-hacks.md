#### Hack #1 (HTML)
> - This hack works and I added additions things to the code so that the button once clicked brings to a wikipidia page and the pictures are linked too. I think for this I should get 0.5/0.5

#### Hack #2 (Data types/Lists)
> - In this hack I edited an array I created inside 'object'. I didn't add anything extra so I think I should get 0.45/0.5

#### Hack #3 (DOM)

> - In this hack I created a code that once the button is clicked, the two links would change. I didn't add anything extra so I think I should get 0.45/0.5

#### Hack #4 (JS)

> - In this hack I created a quiz about F1 and has  the variable comparison. For think I think I should get 0.5/0.5

#### Hack #5 (debugging)

> - For this I did all the hacks/corrects to the code and it works. I also attempted to do the challenge by failed. So I think I should get 0.45/0.5
