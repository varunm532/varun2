### What I learned
> Week 1
- When cloning a repository, don't clone it under a already existing repo, put it under the vscode directory
- Read.md is something that everyone using GitHub should have. I contain instruction and background info about your projects.
- to code in python make a .py file
- to post code in your site, put your code in a .ipynb file and place it under _notebooks as it won't work under _site
- .md files won't work under _notebooks
- 'def' in python defines a function and can be called at anytime after the function is defined.
