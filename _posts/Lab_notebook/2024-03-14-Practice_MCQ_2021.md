On this test, I understood so much more compared to last time. I felt like  it did the faster than last time becuase the question were more consuptiol than last test so I didn't spend that much time in calculations. I also answer a majority of question by not reading the question and answers completly. It worked most of the time, BUT I did misread some question, especially on coding problems. But I had to ruch and quess on some question because of the time constrants and I was loosing some focus. But overall I felt better on this test than the last two.
# Corrections:
### Question 17
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/q17wrong.png"/>

-  For this question, I misread/didn't understand the question. I though that if point A,d,e where disconneted, then B wouldn't be able to connect to C. But I was supposed to connections, not points, so the correct answer would be B-A, B-D, B-E, and B-G. So the answer is b

### Question 25:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/q25wrong.png"/>

- For this question, I couldn't comprehent it and overall didn't understand the answer choices. n is the max value of itteration so the program calculates additon from 1 which is the initial value of result(variable) until the limit of itteration which is n. So the addition can be possible for intigerst between 1 and n.
### Question 43:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/q43wrong.png"/>

- The reason I got this wrong was the I didn't spend enough time in reading each quesiton. I skimmed option c and believed it said the unsecure website logs what people types, instead of a 3rd party person interseption the information. Option A is correct because it actually states the program captures all user input. 
### Question 55:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/q55wrong.png"/>

- In this question I read too fast and didn't answer the correct question. For this I belived that you were supposted to reverse the list. But instead, you were supposed to just replace the last term and place it infront. The option I chose whould have answered the question I imagined IF it was itteration. But option c would have correctly deleted the last term and inserted into the first term. 
### Question 69:
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/q69wrong.png"/>

- For this question, I was rushing and just wanted to finish the question before leaving school. For this reason, I just randomly guess the answer. The correct answer is A and D. This is because option a and d answers the metadata( time, data, and location)
# Question I was confused/guess due to time:

- This was the last question and I was lucky since I chose the same answer options for the past 3 questions. Revisting now I uderstand how to answer this questin. Option A is : "best" --> "be" "s" "t" where s is remove then "be" +"t" = "bet"
Option C is : is the same process as a, BUT instead of using variables in concat, it directly does the  substring calculation in the concat.
