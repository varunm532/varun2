##  Javascript Login and Signup Pages Team Teach
 -200 (OK): Returned on successful login or signup.
 - 401 (Unauthorized): Returned when a user enters incorrect login credentials.
 - 403 (Forbidden): Returned when a user tries to access a resource they don’t have permission for.
 - 409 (Conflict): Can be used if a new user is trying to register with an email/username that already exists.
 - Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in Flask to return meaningful error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes.
## Login/signup
 - #### Ways to be more secure:
   - Token-Based Authentication: Implement token-based authentication, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth, to securely manage user sessions. Tokens should be generated securely, have a limited lifespan, and be securely stored on the client side.

   - Secure Password Storage: Hash and salt passwords before storing them in the database. Use strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to protect user passwords from being exposed in the event of a data breach.

   - Authentication Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints. This can involve limiting the number of login attempts within a specified time period to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access.

   - Secure User Registration: Implement validation and sanitization checks on user registration inputs to prevent injection attacks. Verify the authenticity of email addresses and usernames during the registration process.

   - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Encourage or require users to enable MFA to add an additional layer of security. This can involve using one-time codes sent via SMS, email, or authenticator apps.

   - Session Management: Implement secure session management practices. Ensure that session tokens are securely stored and transmitted, and consider implementing session timeout and re-authentication mechanisms.

   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Implement measures to protect against CSRF attacks. Use anti-CSRF tokens and ensure that requests from legitimate users originate from trusted sources.

   - Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Use parameterized queries for database interactions.

   - Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging for login/signup activities. Monitor and log failed login attempts, unusual patterns, and potential security events to detect and respond to security incidents.

   - API Key Security: If applicable, secure API keys used for authentication and authorization. Ensure that keys are kept confidential, rotated regularly, and that access is restricted to only necessary entities.

   - Regular Security Audits and Updates: Conduct regular security audits of your codebase and dependencies. Stay updated on security best practices and promptly apply patches and updates to address any vulnerabilities. –>

## User Profile Lesson
 - Create request used for the addition of new users
 - Post-request displays are user data table 
 - Put request implemented to update user information
Delete request removes specified users
 - ### CRUD:
   - Create: POST requests
     - Creates new user with input data
     - Performs error checking
     - Sets up user object -> adds to user database
   - Read: GET requests
     - Handles user retrieval requests
     - Data -> JSON + response
   - Update: PUT/PATCH requests
     - Updates based on user input
     - Commits changes to user database
     - This is done with the PUT request
   - Delete: DELETE requests
     - Handles user delete requests
     - Deletes user from database

## JWT roles:
 - JWT Roles: JWT (JSON Web Token) roles are used to define the permissions and access levels of a user or system within an application. These roles are typically encoded within the JWT payload.
 - Single-factor authentication is used when a user provides a username/email/phone number and a password. This is the most common and weakest authentication factor. The user simply inputs the email and password, and the system checks if the data is valid; if valid, the user gets authenticated and can access the resource.
 - Mulit-factor authentication uses more than one factor to authenticate a user. For example, the user tries to log in with an email and password; if the data is correct, a code is sent to the user’s account registered phone number. If the user enters the code, the user will be logged in; otherwise, the user is not authenticated.
- Authentication verifies identity
- authorization grants or denies permissions and verifies a user has the correct credentials to execute tasks
