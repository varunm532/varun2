( I ended the tri with 93.4%)

### Collaboration
- Me, Nandan, Torin, and Sergi collaborated often for our CPT project, CPT warmup project, and spot checks to make sure everyone knew what to do. We used slack and discord to communicate and share our finding and often talked during class to help each other with issues.  We also called to work together to merge all of our project. After we completed our CPT project, we came together to peer review for errors or bugs in our code.


### Ap preparations:
 - I took notes an all teach teaches and and regularly updated my lab notebook. This includes notes from tri 1 and tr2  and these notes contain important notes that are going to help me review for the ap test. The below link is my blog with it has notes that I took.:
