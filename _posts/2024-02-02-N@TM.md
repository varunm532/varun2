### Blog/Article on you and team:
- The key takeaway from N@TM was the theme and idea we presented which was relatable to many people visted our demo. Out them was money and my feature was paper stock trading of the top 25 stocks.
- While demoing our project at N@TM, we got the oppurnity to talk and meet multiple parents who were intersted in our theme and porject idea. This event was great opportunity to work on my presntation skills and help me improve my ability to explain my feature and the project so that people understood what our project was about. This event also helped me and my team to improve on collobration. During our demo, all of our features worked prefectly and we incountered no errors. 
- During N@TM, all of us got insightfull feedback from the people who viewed our project.One feadback was the price for each stock was not real/static and they recomented to use a 3rd party api to pull realtime price change or at least update the price at the end of the day.I also got the recomendation to have a sell feture and a graph to show the user's money growth. I plan to add these features so that my cpt project will be fully connected and would have no missing ends. 

### Blog on event:

- Something that I was impressed was the use of AI and machine learning to help people learn ASL. It was a CSA project and had intractive features which allows a person to improve their ASL learning by judging on how well their ASL letters were.
